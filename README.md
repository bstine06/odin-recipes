"Odin Recipes" is the first HTML practice exercise included in the Odin project.

The goal of this exercise is to use basic HTML to present data in a readable format. As per the project specifications, there are only three different recipes included on the website, but many more could be added. I feel this is enough, however, to show my understanding of the most basic HTML concepts.

Please note all of the content for the recipes has been taken from allrecipes.com, from the following links:
